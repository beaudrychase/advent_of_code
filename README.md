# advent_of_code

This is where I plan on collecting my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions for 2024.

# Setup

This repo is set up to be used with Devcontainers in VSCode for local development. All you need to do is open the project in VSCode then open in Devcontainer. If you want a version of this repo without my code I've made a [template](https://github.com/beaudrychase/advent_of_code/tree/template) branch. 

# Testing

It is not recommended to commit inputs and outputs to tests you come up with. Test files are added to the `.gitignore`. To create a new test case you need to create two files, a `.in` to hold the input and a `.out` to hold the expected output.
